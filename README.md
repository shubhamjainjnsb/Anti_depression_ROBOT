# Anti_depression_ROBOT
The aim is to develop a software plus hardware that uses AI based algorithms to determine if the user is under any sort of physical/mental/emotional trauma and thus under any sort of depression.  The bot is capable of generating an report for the user and also alerts his/her care-taker in case of threats to life and severe symptoms of depression using the GSM module.  Also using the camera module the Chatbot is capable of deterring the mood of the user using facial expressions. The chatbot is very interactive with the user and can perform tasks such as setting alarms, remainders, to-do-lists etc. The chatbot is integrated into Raspberry Pi3 and thus converted into a mobile robot which follows its user and then interacts . The robot is fitted with sensors to detect fire, smoke and gas in case of emergencies. And Our research shows that by using this chat-bot the level of depression of user decreases gradually.
In order to operate thi bot please only main file and then according to your pc you may select the way of conversation.
